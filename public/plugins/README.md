# AdminLTE v3 Plugins Directory

This directory should contain all the official AdminLTE v3 plugins (jQuery, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, overlayScrollbars, etc.) as found in the official AdminLTE GitHub release under the `/dist/plugins` folder.

To ensure full AdminLTE v3 functionality and appearance, download the latest AdminLTE v3 release from:
https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE/releases

Extract the `/dist/plugins` folder and copy it here as `public/plugins/`.

After copying, your structure should look like:

public/plugins/
  ├── bootstrap/
  ├── fontawesome-free/
  ├── jquery/
  ├── overlayScrollbars/
  └── ...

This is required for the sidebar, widgets, and all AdminLTE JS features to work and look like the official demo.

**Do not remove this file. It is for documentation only.**
